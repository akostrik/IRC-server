This project involves creating a simple IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server in C++. The goal is to develop a non-blocking server (no forking and using only one poll), that is fully compatible with an official IRC client, providing a platform for real-time text messaging in a network.
  
Examples of IRC technologies:  
* WeeChat
  
* POSIX specification for poll: If the value of fd is less than 0, events shall be ignored, and revents shall be set to 0 in that entry on return from poll()
* Wireshark utility
* `nc -v`
